UNIT 1

The initial unit of the research methods and professional practice module focused upon the ethics of research and the scientific method. As a result of my transition from a career in Finance to Computing, my main focus has been on learning as much as possible from previous cyber security centered modules in the course. I was not largely familiar with the ethics of computing. However, Unit 1 revealed the vital tenets of computing ethics which will be beneficial in my career as a cyber security professional. Stahl et al (2016) postulates that the incorporation of digital technologies into our career and personal lives results in considerable ethical consequences which Information Technology Professionals must be cognizant of.  

As a result, the code of conduct of the British Computer Society revealed the vital ethical principles which must be imbibed by information Technology professionals.  The British Computer Society (2022) states that as a computing professional, it is imperative to have reliability and display proficiency with the zeal to learn constantly, coupled with the integrity to undertake responsibilities which are within the abilities of my skillset. These are crucial ethical principles which I will imbibe in my career as an Information Technology professional.

UNIT 2 

The second unit of the research methods and professional practice module centered upon the various aspects of formulating a research proposal, starting with the definition of a research question. 
A particular element of the research proposal was the formulation of a literature review, focusing on a particular topic within the computing field. 

As a result of my background in Economics, prior to my undertaking of the module I was vaguely accustomed to literature reviews in general. Nonetheless, the suggestions posited by Dawson (2015) on the vital analytical cognizance of the selected topic such as the understanding of the limitations of existing literature related to the literature review subject, coupled with the interpretation of literature review research formulation as a disputable landscape, where alternate evaluative judgments may be postulated. Consequently, I was anxious at the start of the literature review assignment, however, the aforementioned recommendations from Dawson (2015) improved my critical thinking skills, leading to my attainment of a merit grade in the literature review.

Unit 3 

The third unit of the research methods and professional practice module focused on the principles of exploratory and conclusive research design. Furthermore, the adoption of research methods consisting of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods was examined in the unit. Due to my background in Economics, I am familiar with the use of the aforementioned research methods to convey economic investment opportunities and pitfalls. However, it was stimulating to familiarize myself with research methods in the context of computing.

UNIT 4 

The concentration of this unit was on data collection methods which are commonly utilized for qualitative research and occasionally used for quantitative research. In addition, I was not familiar with the concept of observation in research techniques. Consequently, this unit was beneficial in familiarizing me with the concept.  Dawson (2015) states that there are numerous issues encompassing observational research such as arrangements, recording the observation, and participation.

UNIT 5

The fifth unit of the research methods and professional practice module centered upon the use of interviews and survey methods in qualitative research. I am not proficient with the use of interviews as a research method, however the adoption of interviews as a method of primary research in the final MSc Cyber Security project will be advantageous. Dawson (2015) postulates that interviews are undertaken in an organized and disorganized manner, consisting of the assortment of interviewees, questionnaires, note taking, and ethical concerns.

UNIT 6

The sixth unit of the research methods and professional practice module concentrated upon the various aspects of designing a questionnaire. I was introduced to the use of questionnaires as a form of primary research in unit 5 of the module. Nonetheless, the examination of questionnaire design methods in this unit will enhance my competence related the implementation of primary research in the final MSc Cyber Security project.  Brace (2013) denotes that irrespective of the utilized data collection method, a questionnaire which will deliver precise data must be deliberated in prior to the preparation of any questions, incorporating the secondary information which is essential for analytical resolutions.

UNIT 7 

The seventh unit of the research methods and professional practice module involved the examination of a trio of vital importance in research such as such as validity, generalisability and reliability due to the effect of these principles on the conclusion of research following the gathering of data. Kaplan & Maxwell (2015) state that dangers to the validity of research which introduce a bias and impede research integrity are addressed predominantly during the analytical gathering of data.

UNIT 8

The eighth unit of the research methods and professional practice module concentrated on numerous ways to portray data and the formulation of hypothesis tests. As a result of my background in Business Economics, I utilized hypothesis testing in the first and final years of my bachelorâ€™s degree. However, this was 5 years ago. Thus, the examination of hypothesis testing in unit 8 of the module refamiliarized me with inferential statistics. Berenson et al (2015) denotes that hypothesis testing is usually initiated with a principle, an assertion, or a claim related to a certain population parameter.

UNIT 9 

The ninth unit of the research methods and professional practice module concentrated on the distinctive methods of quantitative data analysis such as the visualization of numerical data which will be a vital form of data analysis in the final MSc Cyber Security Project. Berenson et al (2015) states that the visualization of data is implemented with the adoption of methods which reveal the dispersal of values such as the stem and leaf display, the histogram, and the cumulative percentage polygon.

UNIT 10

The tenth unit of the research methods and professional practice module focused on research writing, which is a highly coveted skill in my career field of information security, governance, risk, and compliance. In addition, the comprehension of research writing will be beneficial with the writing of the MSc Cyber Security Project. 
I believe that I am highly skilled in research writing. However, a notable point of development in the feedback for my literature review assignment was to make my research subjects more focused. Subsequently, it is vital that I am more specific in terms of my research topic and arguments, as this makes management and finalization of research writing significantly straightforward (University of Essex, 2012).

Unit 11

The eleventh unit of the research methods and professional practice module focused on the professional development of the e-portfolio component of the module.  Furthermore, formulating an e-portfolio is extremely beneficial to students and professionals regardless of the industry in which they work. The development of my e-portfolio ensured that I documented the comprehensive set of learning resources which encompassed my whole academic journey on the MSc Cyber security program. Consequently, this permits me to showcase my e-portfolio at the conclusion of the course which can be distributed to potential employers in the information security industry. Ring et al (2017) denote, as a result of the competitive job market, the formulation of an e-portfolio can result in increased worker mobility across geographical locations and a reduction in unemployment rates.

UNIT 12

The twelfth unit of the research methods and professional practice module focused on the subject of project management and the management of risk within a project with the use of suitable reporting and control mechanisms.  Chapman (2019) states that projects signify considerable financial investments by respective corporations and are vital to the improvement corporate growth and business survival. As a result, effective project risk management is crucial in the prediction and mitigation of dangers to the goals of a project.  As a result, the teachings from this unit will beneficial in my career as an information security professional and during the final MSc Cyber Security project in terms of proactive planning and time management.
