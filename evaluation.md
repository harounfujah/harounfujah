Introduction

The principal focus of this literature review will be the use of information systems to transform the Healthcare sector in the United Kingdom.

The target readers of the review comprise of international healthcare strategy makers who endeavor to acquire comprehensions from the triumphs and letdowns of the British approach to the utilization of information systems in the healthcare sector (Sheikh et al, 2021).



Main arguments 


The National Health service continues in being disintegrated in terms of its provision of quality digital healthcare services (Sood &McNeil, 2017).  This was apparent in 2002, following the introduction of the NHS agenda for Information Technology (Parkin, 2016)

The program objective included the movement of all clinical physicians and medical facilities in the United Kingdom to an amalgamated and interoperable medical database (Wilson & Khansa, 2018). 

The NHS program for IT endeavored to eradicate the hindrances related to the use of diverse healthcare information system vendors in the United Kingdom (The Centre for Public Impact, 2017).

The successful implementation of healthcare information systems in the United Kingdom demands the coordination of various stakeholders in the British healthcare sector Wilson & Khansa, 2018). 


Conclusion 

Competent healthcare information system governance at nationwide and state levels is essential to successfully administer digital medical databases in the United Kingdom (Sheikh et al, 2021).
