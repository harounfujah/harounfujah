Summary Post 

My initial post highlighted the vulnerabilities present in a medical mannequin training scenario in the ‘Compromising a Medical Mannequin’ paper such as denial of service attacks and live CD brute force attacks (Glisson et al., 2015). I stated that a favorable countermeasure to denial of service attacks is the adoption of an Anomaly Intrusion Detection System. In addition, I recommended the use of two factor authentication to mitigate against the live CD brute force attack.

As Dr Beran mentioned, it is imperative that healthcare service providers implement zero trust architecture in their security policies. Zero trust architecture erodes the traditional security frontier and assures that enterprise resource data is available solely to entities who are duty-bound to access confidential data and allows only the minimal privileges required to carry out the task (Rose et al. 2020). This enables healthcare establishments to implement improved defenses over their networks, enterprise resources and IoT devices.  

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises that healthcare service providers constrain medical device access to trusted users with the use of authentication programs and distinct authorization privileges for a caregiver relative to a system administrator for instance (Webb & Dayal, 2017). This can be achieved with a zero-trust access system, whereby the objective is to circumvent unlawful access to privileged information with granular access control enforcement (Rose et al. 2020).

In a zero trust access system, access is granted through a policy decision point and a consequent policy enforcement point, when a user requires admittance to enterprise data. The system confirms that the user is genuine and the request is acceptable. The PDP and PEP enforces the decision to permit the user access to the system. This infers zero trust in both authentication and authorization parameters, due to the contraction of implicit trust zones whilst upholding system availability. Therefore, this strengthens the security posture of healthcare services at large as authorized and approved personnel can access IoT devices and enterprise resource data at the exclusion of malicious individuals.

In conclusion, users of implantable medical devices should employ decent cyber hygiene by teaching themselves the risks of buying medical devices which do not have the adequate security tools in place. Government agencies must adopt a greater presence in examining cybersecurity threats in the healthcare sector in order to offer knowledgeable guidance on present and forthcoming threats (Webb & Dayal, 2017).
