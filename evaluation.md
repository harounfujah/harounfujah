Evaluation of Kali Linux and Nessus Scanning Tools


Kali Linux is an open source, Linux distribution which information security professionals employ to carry out sophisticated penetration testing and security auditing.  One particular advantage of using Kali Linux is that it offers significant and diverse tools aimed at security research, computer forensics and reverse engineering.  Kali Linux is also freely available to its users as do they do not need to pay to access the available tools (What is Kali Linux?, 2021).

However, Kali Linux can be perplexing to operate for a new user.(Leroux, 2021) states that new users of Kali Linux are faced with an intense learning curve and proposes alternative, more user-friendly distributions such as Linux Mint or Zorin OS. 

Nessus is a renowned vulnerability assessment tool which requires a monetary payment to use its services such as the examination of software imperfections, absent patches and misconfiguration concerns for numerous Operating Systems (Robb, 2019).

On the other hand, Nessus pinpoints vulnerabilities and does not penetrate them. As a result, Nessus must be utilized in combination with a penetration testing tool such as Kali Linux (What is Kali Linux?, 2021).
