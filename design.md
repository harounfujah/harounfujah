Introduction

This research proposal will assess the use of information systems to transform the Healthcare sector in the United Kingdom.

Aims and Objectives – The benefits of healthcare information systems 

Digital medical databases permit patients sick persons to access the healthcare information concerning their diagnosis and previous healthcare treatments (Mucaraku & Ali, 2022).

Digital medical databases reduce the financial burden on medical organizations in the United Kingdom due to the reduced demand for staff which collate paper bases healthcare records (Mucaraku & Ali, 2022).


Aims and Objectives - The drawbacks of healthcare information systems 

The software coding and execution of digital medical databases inflict a considerable financial burden on hospitals Mucaraku & Ali, 2022).

Digital medical databases are significantly susceptible to cyber attacks (National Cyber Security Centre, 2020).


The contribution of cloud based digital medical databases to revamp the medical industry in the United Kingdom 

Cloud based digital medical databases permit the United Kingdom to coordinate the databases of its healthcare organizations on the cloud (Kurdi et al, 2017). 


Conclusion 

The revolution of the medical industry in the United Kingdom with the use of digital medical databases will be unsuccessful as a result of the deficiency of harmonized digital medical database providers in the United Kingdom (Zhang & Xu, 2006).
